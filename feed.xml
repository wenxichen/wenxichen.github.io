I would like to share some thoughts and inspiration without going too much into the technical stuff. More specifically, my thoughts are mainly on the worm C. Elegans workshop and interpretability. Hopefully it would be useful for others’ research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;on-c-elegans&quot;&gt;On C. Elegans&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caenorhabditis_elegans&quot;&gt;C. Elegans&lt;/a&gt; is a worm. What’s special about it is that all of its neurons have been completely mapped out. So the Workshop on Worm’s Neural Information Processing tries to bridge between the neural science research on C. Elegans and machine learning. I personally have never heard about C. Elegans before the workshop. But the workshop turned out to be really interesting and inspiring. So I believe it would be a good topic to share with other machine learning researchers or enthusiasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interpretability:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C. Elegans workshop:&lt;/p&gt;
